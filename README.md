# Google Clone

This project is a simple clone of the Google homepage, built using HTML and CSS. It serves as one of my first projects after learning the fundamentals of web development. Through this project, I explored various HTML elements and CSS properties, gaining hands-on experience in layout design, styling, and responsive design.

## Features
- Clean and minimalistic design
- Responsive layout that adapts to different screen sizes
- Basic functionality mimicking the Google search experience

## Technologies Used
- HTML
- CSS

This project helped solidify my understanding of web fundamentals and inspired me to continue learning and experimenting with web technologies. Feel free to explore the code and provide any feedback!
